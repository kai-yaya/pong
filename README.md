# Pong
literally shitty pong
## Controls:
### left side 
w - up
s - down
### right side
i - up 
l - down

## Todo
- Fatser move keys (left and right shift?)
- Ball angles (when hitting diff parts of platform)
- scoring, and maybe faster balls with higher scoring
- not kms-ing after forgetting () in ```obj->x += (MOVE_SPEED-1) * ball_moving_right;```
